# Thumbnail-Generator
Basic thumbnail generator for video files written in Python. As of right now, the script will take a video file as input and take the frame at the 30 second mark as a thumb nail, and create a thumbnails folder and save it there.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The script must be in the same directory as the video files you'd like to make thumbnails for.
